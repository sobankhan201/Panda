## ✨ Features

- High-performance `DataFrame` object for structured data
- Integrated handling of missing data
- Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, Parquet, etc.)
- Intelligent data alignment and reshaping
- Powerful group-by functionality
- Time series-specific functionality

## 📦 Installation

Install pandas via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
Or using conda:
